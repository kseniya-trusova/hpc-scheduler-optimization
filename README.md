# Description
This repository is the contribution to the High Performance Computer Workload Optimization project organized by the High School of Artificial Intelligence at the Polytechnic University. 

The repository contains the notebook including the investigation of supercomputer workload and resources consumption, and users behavior investigation (users, the groups of users, industries). The users behavior investigation part does not include detailed explanations and conclusions that were provided in the annual project report.
# Project details
The goal of the project is to optimize the high performance computer (HPC) center workload by the jobs scheduler based on the Slurm system and other monitoring systems.

The project contains several stages. The first stage was to investigate the recordings of jobs placed in the HPC center, analyze jobs attributes and find significant features, which influence jobs scheduling and could be used for the scheduler adjustment by machine learning techniques. 

The data were extracted from the monitoring systems databases such as Slurm and others. The recordings were collected from the middle of June to the middle of November and include different jobs attributes.
